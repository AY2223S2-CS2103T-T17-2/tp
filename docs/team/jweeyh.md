### Project: SudoHR

SudoHR is a desktop app specially catered for HR professionals in managing manpower,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, SudoHR can get your
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
